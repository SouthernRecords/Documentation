# Southern Records Documentation

Southern Records was founded in the spirit of DIY, and is arguably either
directly or indirectly the prototype for the way many other labels work.

One of the things we'd like to do is share knowledge about how we have solved
some problems.

This repository is a store of knowledge we have gained and hope may be useful
to others. The knowledge is not strictly technical.
